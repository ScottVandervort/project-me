	Copied the Data Access Layer from CriminalIntent - and re-factored it to better suit my "Me" app.
	I Basically removed a bunch of stuff - but added a "type" indicator to determine what should be displayed - text, photo, or header.
			
	Created a Unit Test to test the SQLLite stuff by following this :

	Constraint layouts were driving me crazy. The secret is to NOT always add top AND bottom constraints to Views.
	It'll pull/stretch them haphazardly.

	My sole TextView was gaining focus on Activity startup. This helped fixing that problem :

	Still need to know how to "leave" the TextView after explicitly clicking on it.

=========

	Refactored the application. Not everything needs to be Fragments. In fact it just complicates things if it's not going to be re-used.

	Can now select photos from Gallery and/or Camera. These links helped:

	Simplified the DatePickerDialog. These links helped:

		Where file directories point ....

			getFilesDir().getAbsolutePath() => /data/user/0/com.scottsjewels.android.me/files
		
			Environment.getDataDirectory().getAbsolutePath() => /data
			
		Creating a new Directory(s) ....
		
			File myDir = new File ( directory_path );
			boolean isSuccess = myDir.mkdirs();
			
		Directory / File exists ...
		
			File myDir = new File ( directory_path );
			myDir.exists();
			
		
		
		A FileProvider grants access to another Application to write to your Application's location.

		Gallery having problems writting to INTERNAL_STORAGE. Can write fine to external storage.
	
	
Q&A
===	
	1) What is the difference between INTERNAL / EXTERNAL storage. Specifically, does one require a SD Card - or does it mean external to the application?
	
		EXTERNAL storage is just that - an external or mounted SD Card. It may not be available on a Device.
		
		What is External Storage?
		https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/data/data-storage#filesExternal
		
		How to check if External Storage Exists - and write to it.
		https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/files#WriteExternalStorage
		
		
		Why don't captured images fill entire ImageView - are they poor quality?

		Allow user to specify file name ( check for duplicates )?

		Move strings to resources

		Add logging.
